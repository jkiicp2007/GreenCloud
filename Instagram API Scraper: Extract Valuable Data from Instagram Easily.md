## How to Use Instagram API Scraper

Instagram API Scraper is simple to use, with minimal setup required. Just follow these steps:

1. **Create a free Apify account**: Sign up for access to the Apify platform.
2. **Open Instagram API Scraper**: Navigate to the Instagram API Scraper tool.

## How Many Results Can You Scrape?

The number of results you can scrape depends on the content, the complexity of the input, and other factors like location. To get an idea of whatâ€™s accessible, open the relevant Instagram URL in an incognito browser session and observe what is available to users who are not logged in. Run test scrapes to ensure accuracy and to estimate potential output for your needs.

## Cost of Scraping Instagram

Scraping costs vary based on the volume of data and use case. Run a small test scrape with limited data to calculate the cost per scrape. You can then estimate expenses for larger-scale scrapes. Upgrading to a higher plan can help you save on recurring costs in the long term.

## Legal and Ethical Web Scraping

Our Instagram scrapers do not extract private data, such as email addresses or personal details. They only access publicly available data that users choose to share. While the scrapers are designed to comply with ethical web scraping practices, you should ensure that your use case aligns with relevant laws like GDPR or similar regulations in your region. Consult legal experts if in doubt. Read more on [ethical web scraping](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi).
