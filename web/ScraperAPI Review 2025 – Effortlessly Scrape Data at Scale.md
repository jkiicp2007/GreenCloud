### Implementing ScraperAPI in Node.js

```javascript
const ScraperAPI = require('scraperapi-sdk');
const apiKey = 'YOUR_SCRAPERAPI_KEY'; // Replace with your ScraperAPI key
const scraper = new ScraperAPI(apiKey);

async function scrapeWebsiteContent(url) {
  try {
    let response = await scraper.get(url);
    console.log('Response data:', response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error scraping website:', error);
  }
}

let url = "https://google.com"; // Replace with the URL you want to scrape
scrapeWebsiteContent(url);
```

#### Code Explanation:
1. **Import ScraperAPI SDK**: The code imports `scraperapi-sdk`.
2. **Provide API Key**: Replace `'YOUR_SCRAPERAPI_KEY'` with the ScraperAPI key received after registration.
3. **Initialize ScraperAPI**: Create an instance of ScraperAPI with your API key.
4. **Asynchronous Function**: Define an async function `scrapeWebsiteContent()` to handle data scraping tasks.
5. **Try-Catch Block**: Handle potential errors and log successful responses to the console.
6. **Execute the Function**: Pass the desired website URL to the function for scraping.

> **Note**: Ensure you install the `scraperapi-sdk` by running the command:
