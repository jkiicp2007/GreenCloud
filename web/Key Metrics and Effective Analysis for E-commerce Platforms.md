## Stage 1: Data Collection

Data collection is the first step in the process. Successful e-commerce operations rely on gathering metrics across multiple categories. A robust system typically tracks:

- **Traffic Metrics**: IPs, page views (PVs), session duration, bounce rates.
- **Order Metrics**: Total orders, effective orders, sales revenue, average order value.
- **Conversion Rates**: Checkout conversion rates, payment completion rates.
- **Retention Metrics**: Returning customer percentage, loyalty program impact.
- **Operational Metrics**: Fulfillment rates, delivery timelines, return rates.

### Key Tip:
Focus on the most relevant metrics for your current business goals, rather than attempting to track every available KPI.

## Stage 2: Data Analysis

Once the data is collected, the next step is to analyze it to identify patterns and actionable insights. For e-commerce, this can include:

- **Traffic Sources**: Analyze where users are coming from (e.g., search engines, social media, email marketing) and optimize high-performing channels.
- **Customer Behavior**: Understand browsing habits, purchase frequency, and retention rates.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Monitor fulfillment times, return rates, and inventory turnover.

### Key Focus Areas for Analysis:
1. **Traffic Insights**:
   - Determine high-converting traffic sources.
   - Allocate more resources to successful channels.

2. **Order Insights**:
   - Track effective order rates and identify reasons for cart abandonment.
   - Calculate metrics like customer acquisition costs (CAC) versus customer lifetime value (CLV).

3. **Customer Retention**:
   - Measure average customer retention periods.
   - Identify loyal customers who drive referrals and repeat sales.
