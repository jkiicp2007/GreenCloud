In our daily study or work, we often encounter scenarios requiring data scraping, such as collecting research papers for academic projects, gathering user reviews for operational activities, or fetching competitor data for business analysis.

When faced with the inefficiency of copying and pasting, many people wish they knew how to scrape data with ease. However, most tutorials online have steep learning curves that may deter beginners. For instance, learning Python-based web scraping involves mastering several concepts:

![Python Scraping Workflow](https://image-1255652541.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/uPic/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87%201.png)

- **Programming Language**: Learning Python
- **Web Basics**: HTML tags, CSS selectors, and sometimes JavaScript
- **Network Protocols**: Understanding HTTP protocols
- **Scraping Frameworks**: Familiarizing with common Python libraries and frameworks for scraping
- ...and more.

For someone without a strong need for advanced scraping, learning all these concepts can take months and involves constant practice to avoid forgetting them. 

Is there a way to scrape data without needing programming skills? Enter **Web Scraper**, a lightweight tool designed for beginners!

## Installing Web Scraper

Web Scraper is a Chrome extension. Users with stable internet can install it directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon). For those with slower connections, you can download the extension manually. Follow my step-by-step guide for installation: [Web Scraper Download & Installation](https://www.cnblogs.com/web-scraper/p/web_scraper_download.html).

## Common Types of Web Pages

Based on my experience and feedback from readers, I categorize web pages into three main types: **Single Page**, **Paginated Lists**, and **Filterable Forms**.

![Page Types](https://image-1255652541.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/uPic/image-20200517171919628.png)

### 1. Single Page
Single pages are the simplest and most common type of web page. Blog articles, news posts, and similar content fall under this category. My [first Web Scraper tutorial](https://sspai.com/post/55496) uses Douban Movies as an example to introduce basic usage.

### 2. Paginated Lists
Paginated lists are widely used on the web. Instead of loading all data at once, websites dynamically load content as you interact with them (e.g., scrolling, filtering, or navigating pages). I‚Äôve written detailed guides on scraping different pagination types, which you can find in the next section.

### 3. Filterable Forms
Filterable forms, like shopping filters on e-commerce sites, allow users to sort data based on various criteria. Unfortunately, Web Scraper has limitations here. It can scrape data if the filtering conditions are reflected in the URL but struggles with more complex filters.

## Pagination Types and Techniques

Pagination is a common feature of websites that display long lists of content. There are three main types:

### 1. Infinite Scrolling
This method continuously loads new data as you scroll. Web Scraper‚Äôs `Element scroll down` selector is ideal for this scenario. Learn more here: [Scraping Infinite Scroll Pages](https://www.cnblogs.com/web-scraper/p/web_scraper_element_scroll_down.html).

![Infinite Scroll Example](https://img2020.cnblogs.com/blog/1717181/202112/1717181-20211226145310927-905286335.gif)

### 2. Paginator Navigation
Paginator navigation is common on PC websites, where clicking a page number loads corresponding data. Use Web Scraper‚Äôs Link selector to handle such pages. Related guides:

- [Using Web Scraper‚Äôs Element Click Selector](https://www.cnblogs.com/web-scraper/p/web_scraper_element_click_once.html)

### 3. "Next Page" Button
Some sites load additional data only when a ‚ÄúNext Page‚Äù button is clicked. This can also be handled with Web Scraper using the `Element click` selector. Learn more: [Scraping "Next Page" Buttons](https://www.cnblogs.com/web-scraper/p/web_scraper_start_element_click.html).
