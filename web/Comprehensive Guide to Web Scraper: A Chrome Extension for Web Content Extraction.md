### 3. Setting Up Your First Sitemap

#### Create a Sitemap

A sitemap is the backbone of Web Scraper. It defines how the scraper navigates the site and extracts data.

1. Open the landing page (the starting point for scraping).
2. Create a sitemap by entering the landing page URL and defining selectors (elements you want to scrape).

![Sitemap Setup](https://i-blog.csdnimg.cn/blog_migrate/eee93c0fd4ee55bccb3cee099b476b11.png)

#### Add Selectors

Selectors specify which parts of the site to scrape. For example:
- **Category Links**: Navigate top-level categories like "Computers" or "Phones."
- **Subcategories and Products**: Drill down into specific items.

Enable the **Multiple** option if youâ€™re extracting data from lists, and use the **Element Preview** and **Data Preview** buttons to verify.
