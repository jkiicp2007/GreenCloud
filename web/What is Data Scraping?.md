# What is Data Scraping?

## Introduction to Data Scraping

Data scraping, at its core, refers to the technique of extracting data from the output generated by another program. One of the most common forms of data scraping is web scraping, which involves using applications to extract valuable information from websites.

*Why scrape website data?*

Companies often protect their unique content from being downloaded and reused without authorization. They do not make all data openly accessible through APIs or other resources. However, no matter how strict the access restrictions, web scraping bots often attempt to extract website data. This creates an ongoing "cat and mouse" game between web scraping bots and content protection strategies.

Despite the technical complexity, the web scraping process is relatively straightforward. It typically involves three steps:

1. A scraping bot sends an HTTP GET request to a specific website.
2. Upon receiving a response, the bot parses the HTML document to locate specific data patterns.
3. Extracted data is then transformed into a desired format as designed by the bot creator.

### Common Use Cases for Web Scraping

Web scraping bots can be designed for various purposes, including:

- **Content Scraping**  
  Bots can scrape content from websites to replicate or leverage unique services. For instance, platforms like Yelp rely on user reviews. Competitors may scrape these reviews to populate their own websites with seemingly original content.

- **Price Scraping**  
  Competitors can gather pricing data by scraping websites. This allows them to create a competitive pricing strategy.

- **Contact Information Scraping**  
  Many websites list email addresses and phone numbers in plain text. Scraping these details enables bots to compile contact lists for mass emails, robocalls, or even malicious social engineering attacks. Spammers and fraudsters frequently use this method to find new targets.

## How to Protect Against Web Scraping

If content is visible to visitors, it can potentially be scraped. However, there are methods to limit the extent of data scraping:

- **Rate-Limiting Requests**  
  Genuine users interact with websites at predictable speeds. For example, a real user cannot browse 100 pages per second. Bots, on the other hand, can send requests at lightning speeds. By setting rate limits on requests from specific IP addresses, websites can prevent aggressive scraping attempts.

- **Regularly Modify HTML Markup**  
  Scraping bots depend on consistent formatting to extract content effectively. Regularly changing HTML elements, nesting, or introducing random modifications can make it harder for bots to scrape data reliably.

- **Use CAPTCHA for High-Volume Requests**  
  CAPTCHA challenges are effective at slowing down bots. While humans can solve these challenges, bots struggle. However, excessive CAPTCHA usage can negatively impact user experience.

Another less common but effective method is embedding content within media objects, such as images. Since the data isn't stored as text, bots require advanced optical character recognition (OCR) tools to extract information, making the process more complex. However, this approach can inconvenience legitimate users who need to copy details such as addresses or phone numbers.

## Can Web Scraping Be Completely Prevented?

The only way to entirely prevent scraping is by not putting the content online at all. That said, advanced bot management solutions can significantly reduce scraping activity by blocking access for scraping bots.

## Data Scraping vs. Web Crawling: Whatâ€™s the Difference?

Web crawling refers to the process of indexing internet content, typically carried out by large search engines like Google using bots such as Googlebot. In contrast, scraping focuses on extracting specific data from particular websites.

Key differences between scraping bots and web crawlers:

1. **Purpose and Behavior**:  
   Scraping bots often disguise themselves as web browsers, whereas crawlers are transparent about their purpose.

2. **Advanced Techniques**:  
   Scraping bots may perform advanced actions like filling out forms to access restricted areas, whereas crawlers typically do not.

3. **Robots.txt Compliance**:  
   Crawlers respect the `robots.txt` file, which instructs them on which areas of a site to avoid. Scraping bots, however, are usually designed to ignore such restrictions.
