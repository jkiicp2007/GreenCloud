## How to Extract Amazon Product Data Using Google Sheets

Google Sheets, combined with the powerful ImportFromWeb add-on, simplifies the data extraction process. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

### Step 1: Install and Activate the ImportFromWeb Add-On

First, install the ImportFromWeb add-on from the [Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/importfromweb_web_scraping_in_google_she/278587576794). Then, activate the add-on by navigating to:

`Extensions > ImportFromWeb > Activate add-on`

### Step 2: Input the URLs of the ASINs You Want to Analyze

ImportFromWeb requires two parameters: a URL and one or more data selectors. Input the product URLs directly or use the ASINs to build them dynamically:

```excel
="https://www.amazon.com/dp/"&A2
```

### Step 3: Choose and Add Amazon Product Selectors

Data selectors specify the information to extract from Amazon product pages. Examples include:

- **title**
- **brand_name**
- **sale_price**
- **buybox_winner**
- **rating**

Select the attributes relevant to your needs and add them to your spreadsheet. Reference the [Amazon Product Selectors Glossary](https://nodatanobusiness.com/resources/importfromweb-amazon-data-selectors/) for guidance.

### Step 4: Write the =IMPORTFROMWEB() Formula

Use the following formula to extract the data:

```excel
=IMPORTFROMWEB(A2, B1:F1)
```

This will pull the data for the first product listed. Adjust the range as necessary to suit your dataset.

### Step 5: Scale the Data Collection Process

To extract data for multiple products, use the `$` symbol to lock the selectors and drag the formula down the rows:

```excel
=IMPORTFROMWEB(A2, $B$1:$F$1)
```
